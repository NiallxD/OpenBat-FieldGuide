# What is OpenBat?

OpenBat is an iOS app that turns a compatible ultrasonic USB microphone into
a live bat detector. It captures audio at up to 384 kHz, shows a real-time
spectrogram, detects individual echolocation pulses, and, where an openly
available model exists for the region, identifies the species on-device (currently for North America and Canada only but working on UK/Europe).

## Why

Most tools for identifying bat calls are expensive, proprietary, and hard to
get hold of, which puts the experience out of reach for a lot of people who'd
genuinely enjoy it. Free apps that work with ultrasonic microphones already
exist, but as far as we know, none of them use the open-source machine
learning models that have been trained on bat echolocation calls. By building
that identification directly into the app, OpenBat helps people put a name to
the call they just heard, a small moment of recognition that builds a real
connection with bats, and a bit more respect for them too.

## Features

- **Real-time spectrogram:** high-resolution frequency-vs-time display with
  drag-to-scroll history.
- **Pulse detection & zoom:** isolates each call and renders an
  onset-aligned close-up.
- **Species ID:** an on-device classifier names the species, with
  runner-up and confidence.
- **Heterodyne & time-expansion listening:** hear the ultrasound live,
  tuned down or slowed 10×.
- **Sessions & map:** log passes with a GPS track and see where each was
  heard.
- **Community field guide:** a species reference built into the app,
  covering morphology, echolocation, conservation status and habits (see
  below).

## Getting started

Connect a compatible (Griff Mini at the moment, but will work on a list soon!) ultrasonic USB microphone, press Start, and point it at
the sky. Detected passes are logged with their species, confidence, and a
spectrogram of the pulses. Start a Session to also record a GPS track and
map where each pass was heard.

## Species Field Guide

This repo also hosts the **Species Field Guide** data, a single
community-editable JSON file the app downloads and displays in its Species
section. The rest of this README covers how to contribute to that guide.

## Contributing a species or region

The field guide lives entirely in one file: [`SpeciesGuideData.json`](./SpeciesGuideData.json).
No app code changes are needed to add a species, edit an existing entry, or
add a new region, just edit the JSON and open a PR.

1. Fork the repo and edit `SpeciesGuideData.json`.
2. Add your species (or region) following the schema below.
3. **Bump `dataVersion` by 1** and set `updatedAt` to today's date, see
   [Versioning](#versioning). This is required for every content change,
   however small, or the app won't pick it up.
4. Open a PR. Once merged to `main`, every app install picks up the change
   automatically the next time it launches (no app update needed).

### Schema

Top level:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Int | **Don't change this.** See [Versioning](#versioning). |
| `dataVersion` | Int | Bump by 1 on every content edit. |
| `updatedAt` | String (ISO 8601) | e.g. `"2026-07-06T00:00:00Z"`. Set alongside every `dataVersion` bump. |
| `regions` | [Region] | Pins shown on the explorer globe. |
| `species` | [Species] | The field guide entries. |

**Region:**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | String | Stable slug, e.g. `"uk-ireland"`. Referenced by species' `regions` list, don't rename an existing one without updating every species that references it. |
| `name` | String | Display name, e.g. `"UK & Ireland"`. |
| `latitude` / `longitude` | Double | Where the pin sits on the globe. |

**Species:** only `id`, `commonName`, `scientificName`, and `regions` are
required, everything else is optional. Add what you know; leave the rest
out. The app only shows a section if its fields are present, so a sparse
entry just renders a shorter page rather than empty boxes.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | String | Stable slug, e.g. `"pipistrellus-pipistrellus"` (genus-species, lowercase, hyphenated). |
| `commonName` | String | e.g. `"Common Pipistrelle"`. |
| `scientificName` | String | e.g. `"Pipistrellus pipistrellus"`. Genus (for the taxonomy breadcrumb) is parsed from this automatically, don't add a separate genus field. |
| `order` | String? | Taxonomic order, e.g. `"Chiroptera"`. |
| `family` | String? | e.g. `"Vespertilionidae"`. |
| `regions` | [String] | List of region `id`s where this species occurs. |
| `summary` | String? | Short intro paragraph. |
| `measurements` | Object? | `forearmMmRange`, `wingspanCmRange`, `weightGRange` (each `{ "min": Double, "max": Double }`), `color` (free text). |
| `morphology` | Object? | `earType`, `tailType`, `noseType` (free text), `otherFeatures` (array of short strings). |
| `echolocation` | Object? | `callType` (e.g. `"FM"`, `"CF-FM"`), `peakFreqHzRange` (Pf), `characteristicFreqHzRange` (Cf/knee), `freqHighHzRange` (Fhigh), `freqLowHzRange` (Flow), `durationMsRange` — all `{ "min", "max" }` pairs in Hz/ms — plus free-text `notes` and an optional `exemplarImageName` (must match a bundled app image asset; leave unset if you don't have one). |
| `conservation` | Object? | `iucnStatus` (e.g. `"Least Concern"`), `localStatus` (free text, varies by region/authority). |
| `habits` | Object? | `roosting`, `migration`, `feeding`, `reproduction`, `other` — each free text. |
| `references` | [String]? | Citations, rendered verbatim in small type at the foot of the species page. Any format is fine as long as it's readable e.g. `"Author, A. (Year) Title. Journal, Vol(Issue), pages."` |
| `contributors` | [Contributor]? | Edit history shown via a sheet at the top of the References section. **The first entry is treated as the page's creator; every entry after that is an editor.** Each is `{ "name": String, "date": String (ISO 8601), "note": String? }` — add one entry (with today's date and a short note on what you changed) every time you edit a species you didn't create. |

### Example entry

```json
{
  "id": "myotis-daubentonii",
  "commonName": "Daubenton's Bat",
  "scientificName": "Myotis daubentonii",
  "order": "Chiroptera",
  "family": "Vespertilionidae",
  "regions": ["uk-ireland", "continental-europe"],
  "summary": "A small, agile bat that trawls for insects low over still or slow-moving water, using its large feet and tail membrane.",
  "echolocation": {
    "callType": "FM",
    "peakFreqHzRange": { "min": 45000, "max": 50000 },
    "durationMsRange": { "min": 2.0, "max": 5.0 },
    "notes": "Steep, broadband FM sweep; often confused with other Myotis species without call context."
  },
  "conservation": {
    "iucnStatus": "Least Concern"
  },
  "references": [
    "Jones, G. & Rayner, J.M.V. (1988) Flight performance, foraging tactics and echolocation in free-living Daubenton's bats. Journal of Zoology, 215(1), 113–132."
  ],
  "contributors": [
    { "name": "Jane Doe", "date": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z", "note": "Created species profile" },
    { "name": "John Smith", "date": "2026-07-06T00:00:00Z", "note": "Added echolocation measurements" }
  ]
}
```

The first `contributors` entry (Jane Doe here) is the creator; anyone else who
later edits the entry appends their own `{ name, date, note }` after it,
don't overwrite or remove earlier entries.

See existing entries in `SpeciesGuideData.json` for more complete, real
examples.

### Versioning

- **`dataVersion`**: bump this by 1 for *any* content change, new species,
  corrected text, a new reference, anything. The app compares this number
  to decide whether to adopt your update; if you forget to bump it, your
  change won't reach anyone's device even after merging.
- **`updatedAt`**: an ISO 8601 timestamp set alongside every `dataVersion`
  bump, shown in the app's guide footer so users can see how fresh the data
  is.
- **`schemaVersion`**: this is *not* a content-versioning field, leave it
  alone. It only changes when the JSON's *structure* changes in a way old
  app versions can't safely read (e.g. renaming or repurposing an existing
  field), and that requires a coordinated app release. Adding a new
  optional field (as most content contributions will) never needs a
  `schemaVersion` bump.

### What not to touch

Please don't rename or remove an existing region `id` or species `id` in
the same PR as unrelated content changes, other entries and, in the case
of species ids, potentially saved user data reference these by string, so a
rename should be its own deliberate PR.

## Species Range Maps

In addition to the **Species Guide Data** this repo alos holds a JSON file
with coordinates for the species range maps. This JSON is generated manually
and is updated periodically. The OpenBat app downloads new versions of this
file on the fly so no app updates are needed.

**Please do not touch the SpeciesRangeData.json**
